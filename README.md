## OOJS

### Question #1

What are constructor functions and the `new` keyword? What is a prototype? Describe an example of when we would use a constructor function versus a prototype.

Your Answer:
```text
<!-- We use constructor functions to easily create and model different objects that share the same properties. It uses the keyword "this" to create a new object. The 'new' keyword is used to create a new object for that method, and the 'new' keyword calls the constructor function for the new object. We use a prototype when we want the new object to automatically take the properties of the original objects and do not want to rewrite code for the new object (and take up a lot of memory.) -->
```

### Question #2

Define a Javascript constructor called 'Instructor'. Every instance of Instructor should have a `name` property, and a method called `givesHomework`. This method takes one argument called `assignment` and, when executed, console-logs "[name] gives the students [assignment] for Friday's homework."

Instantiate an instructor named 'Robin' and call its `givesHomework` method with "Intro to Ruby" as the argument.

Your Answer:

```js
function Instructor (name) {
  this.name = name
  this.givesHomework = function(argument) {
    console.log( this.name + "gives the students " + assignment + " for Friday's homework.");
  }
}
var quiz = new Instructor ("Robin");
quiz.givesHomework("Intro to Ruby");

```
### Question #3

Given the following front-end JS model, add an instance method for all pandas called `eat_bamboo`. Calling this method should increase that panda's value for `num_bamboo_eaten` by 1.

```js

var Panda = function(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.num_bamboo_eaten = 0;
}
```
Your Answer:
```js

Panda.prototype.eat_bamboo = function(){
  this.num_bamboo_eaten +=1;
}

```

### Question #4

Describe the importance of using object-oriented programming.

Your Answer:
```js
We use object oriented programming in order to make our code dry, eliminate repetition and generally simplify our code so that it does not take up as much space and memory by repeating the same cody in each instance. object-oriented programming allows us to use abstraction, encapsulation and modularity.
```

## jQuery

### Question #5

Which of the following statements will work, assuming jQuery is loaded?

Select all that apply:
```
[X] `$(".post").css("background", "peachpuff")`
[] `$(".post").innerHTML`
[X] `$(".post").html()`
[] `document.querySelectorAll(".post")[0].innerHTML`
[] `document.querySelectorAll(".post").innerHTML`
```

### Question #6

Using jQuery, add an event listener for clicks on the button with the id
`greeting`. When the event happens, the code should append a paragraph to the
body that says "hello".

Your Answer:
```js
$(#greeting).on("click", function(){
  $('body').append(<p>Hello</p>);
});
```

### Question #7

Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, `doSomething` should invoke the `thingToDo` function. Demonstrate calling `doSomething` while passing in an argument.

Your Answer:
```js
function doSomething(thingToDo){
 thingToDo();
}
doSomething(function(){
  console.log("I'm doing something!");
});
```

### Question #8

Once in Vanilla JS, and once in jQuery, write a function that adds an event listener for when a button with a class of "submit-quiz" is clicked. The event alerts a user "Great Job on Quiz 4!".

Your Answer:
```js
//VANILLA JS//
var button = document.getElementsByClassName("submit-quiz");
button.addEventListener("click", function(){
  alert("Great Job on Quiz 4!");
});

//JQUERY//
var button = $('.submit-quiz').on('click', function(){
  alert("Great Job on Quiz 4!");
});
```
