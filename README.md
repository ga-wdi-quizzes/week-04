## OOJS

### Question #1

What are constructor functions and the `new` keyword? What is a prototype? Describe an example of when we would use a constructor function versus a prototype.

Your Answer:
```text
Constructor functions are used to create new instances of an object with shared properties; the 'new' keyword is only used with the constructor when creating a new instance. A prototype is a property associated with the constructor and it can be used to attach additional properties and methods to implement inheritance.

A constructor is useful when you want to create multiple objects with the same properties and methods whereas prototype is used to add on additional properties and methods so that all new instance will inherit the new values.
```

### Question #2

Define a Javascript constructor called 'Instructor'. Every instance of Instructor should have a `name` property, and a method called `givesHomework`. This method takes one argument called `assignment` and, when executed, console-logs "[name] gives the students [assignment] for Friday's homework."

Instantiate an instructor named 'Robin' and call its `givesHomework` method with "Intro to Ruby" as the argument.

```js

var Panda = function(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.num_bamboo_eaten = 0;
}
