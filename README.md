## OOJS

### Question #1

What are constructor functions and the `new` keyword? What is a prototype? Describe an example of when we would use a constructor function versus a prototype.

Your Answer:
```text
A constructor function in javascript is any function which is used as a constructor, JS does not make a distinction. The new keyword is used with a constructor function to generate a new object as designated by the constructor.  The prototype is an empty object that is a property of all JS functions, but when used with an object generated by a constructor it will inherit that constructor's properties.
```

### Question #2

Define a Javascript constructor called 'Instructor'. Every instance of Instructor should have a `name` property, and a method called `givesHomework`. This method takes one argument called `assignment` and, when executed, console-logs "[name] gives the students [assignment] for Friday's homework."

Instantiate an instructor named 'Robin' and call its `givesHomework` method with "Intro to Ruby" as the argument.

Your Answer:

```js
var Instructor = function (name){
  this.name = name;
}

Instructor.prototype.givesHomework = function(assignment){
  console.log(this.name + " gives the students " + assignment + " for Friday's homework.")
}

var robin = new Instructor("Robin");
robin.givesHomework("Intro to Ruby");

```
### Question #3

Given the following front-end JS model, add an instance method for all pandas called `eat_bamboo`. Calling this method should increase that panda's value for `num_bamboo_eaten` by 1.

```js

var Panda = function(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.num_bamboo_eaten = 0;
}
```
Your Answer:
```js
Panda.prototype.eat_bamboo = function(){
  this.num_bamboo_eaten++;
}
```

### Question #4

Describe the importance of using object-oriented programming.

Your Answer:
```js
It allows developers to model their code in a manner that closer resembles our external world.
OOP provides our code with Modularity, Abstraction, and Encapsulation.
```

## jQuery

### Question #5

Which of the following statements will work, assuming jQuery is loaded?

Select all that apply:
```
[X] `$(".post").css("background", "peachpuff")`
[] `$(".post").innerHTML`
[X] `$(".post").html()`
[X] `document.querySelectorAll(".post")[0].innerHTML`
[] `document.querySelectorAll(".post").innerHTML`
```

### Question #6

Using jQuery, add an event listener for clicks on the button with the id
`greeting`. When the event happens, the code should append a paragraph to the
body that says "hello".

Your Answer:
```js
$("#greeting").on("click", function(){
  $("body").append("<p>hello</p>");
})
```

### Question #7

Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, `doSomething` should invoke the `thingToDo` function. Demonstrate calling `doSomething` while passing in an argument.

Your Answer:
```js
function doSomething(thingToDo){
  thingToDo();
}
```

### Question #8

Once in Vanilla JS, and once in jQuery, write a function that adds an event listener for when a button with a class of "submit-quiz" is clicked. The event alerts a user "Great Job on Quiz 4!".

Your Answer:
```js
$(".submit-quiz").on("click", function(){
  alert("Great Job on Quiz 4!");
})

document.getElementByClassName("submit-quiz").addEventListener("click", function(){
  alert("Great Job on Quiz 4!");
})
```
