## OOJS

### Question #1

What are constructor functions and the `new` keyword? What is a prototype? Describe an example of when we would use a constructor function versus a prototype.

Your Answer:
```text
Constructor functions allow you to easily replicate an object by passing in arguments - by using the 'new' keyword when running the function. A prototype allows you to declare methods/attributes for objects at a 'global' level for that particular object.
EX: You may use a constructor function for key-value pairs that are different between all of the objects (ex. passing in name, email address, phone number, etc.) and use a prototype for methods that will be useful for all of those objects (calling the method on one particular object to return name, address, etc.).
```

### Question #2

Define a Javascript constructor called 'Instructor'. Every instance of Instructor should have a `name` property, and a method called `givesHomework`. This method takes one argument called `assignment` and, when executed, console-logs "[name] gives the students [assignment] for Friday's homework."

Instantiate an instructor named 'Robin' and call its `givesHomework` method with "Intro to Ruby" as the argument.

Your Answer:

```js
function Instructor(name, assignment) {
  this.name = name;
  this.assignment = assignment;
  this.givesHomework = function() {
    console.log(this.name + " gives student " +this.assignment+ " for Friday's homework.")
  }
}

var Robin = new Instructor("Robin", "Intro to Ruby");
Robin.givesHomework();

```
### Question #3

Given the following front-end JS model, add an instance method for all pandas called `eat_bamboo`. Calling this method should increase that panda's value for `num_bamboo_eaten` by 1.

```js

var Panda = function(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.num_bamboo_eaten = 0;
}
```

## jQuery

### Question #5

Which of the following statements will work, assuming jQuery is loaded?

Select all that apply:
```
[] `$(".post").css("background", "peachpuff")`
[] `$(".post").innerHTML`
[] `$(".post").html()`
[] `document.querySelectorAll(".post")[0].innerHTML`
[] `document.querySelectorAll(".post").innerHTML`
```

### Question #6

Using jQuery, add an event listener for clicks on the button with the id
`greeting`. When the event happens, the code should append a paragraph to the
body that says "hello".

Your Answer:
```js
// your code here
```

### Question #7

Define a function called `doSomething`. It should take one argument, called
`thingToDo`. When called, `doSomething` should invoke the `thingToDo` function. Demonstrate calling `doSomething` while passing in an argument.

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
```

### Question #8

Once in Vanilla JS, and once in jQuery, write a function that adds an event listener for when a button with a class of "submit-quiz" is clicked. The event alerts a user "Great Job on Quiz 4!".

Your Answer:
```js
// write code here
```
